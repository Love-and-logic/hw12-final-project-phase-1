Hello All!

# Custom URL Shortener

A Berkeley City College final project for Erik Holtz and Sarah Van Wart's MMART 162 class.
The final project is a full stack application of a URL shortener similar to that of bit.ly and goo.gl.

## Getting Started

The client directory has the index.html and an assets folder with the css and javascript.
The server folder contains the app.js which is the mechanics of the url shortener.

The user-entered URLs are stored in: index.js

File structure:

client                                                                                     
.....index.html                                                                        
...../assets                                                                                             
........../js

server                                                                                           
...../routes                                                                                           
..........index.js
